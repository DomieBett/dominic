# 52 WEEK SAVINGS CHALLENGE CALCULATOR

This is a simple node app designed to help me calculate how much I need to save every week to achieve my goals with the Mshwari 52 week savings challenge. If you know what this challenge is, it is designed to help individuals save weekly with increments of 100 shillings (in my case).

This app can be run on the terminal by running node app.js while inside the project folder. It is not a simple application so changes to dates that one needs to view must be done within the application.
