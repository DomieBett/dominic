# Object Oriented Programming.

Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm where life objects are translated into code to store data and perform operations. A typical object in programming will have fields to store data known as attributes and procedures known as methods. Therefore an object has properties that define it, and methods that allow it to perform certain operations.

This is comparably similar to a real world object where an a human has defining properties such as a name, height, age and gender, and has ability to perform operations such as walk, eat, sleep and code.
