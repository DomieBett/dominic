## <u>Binary Search Tree</u>
A binary tree is a data structure that has linked nodes. It has a root node which can have a maximum of 2 child nodes. These nodes are defined by their positions, i.e left or right nodes.

A binary search tree is a form of a binary tree but which has the left node less than the root and the right node greater than the root. It is sorted by default thus it is easier to perform operations such as searching. Its time complexity is `O(h)` since longest time taken equals the height of the binary tree.
