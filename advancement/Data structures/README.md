# Data Structures

## <u>Binary Search Tree</u>
A binary tree is a data structure that has linked nodes. It has a root node which can have a maximum of 2 child nodes. These nodes are defined by their positions, i.e left or right nodes.

A binary search tree is a form of a binary tree but which has the left node less than the root and the right node greater than the root. It is sorted by default thus it is easier to perform operations such as searching. Its time complexity is `O(h)` since longest time taken equals the height of the binary tree.

## <u>Linked Lists</u>
The Linked List data structure has contains nodes which point to another node as the next point in the list. It has a head as the beginning of the linked list and this head is always the beginning of the list. All other nodes are chained together one pointing to the next and so on. The last element points to null. However, in the case of circular linked lists, the last element points to the head.

There are also two way lists which has nodes which points to both the next and the previous nodes.
